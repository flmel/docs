In this article, we will cover how to set up your Rust dev environment on Windows using WSL and install relevant tools to build on and interact with NEAR.

### WSL

WSL, or Windows Subsystem for Linux, is a compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables natively on Windows. It allows us to run a GNU/Linux environment directly on Windows without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dual-boot setup.

#### Enable WSL from `Windows Features`

`Control Panel > Programs > Turn Windows Features on or off` 
Scrolling down will reveal the option `Windows Subsystem for Linux`. Make sure it is enabled and press OK to confirm (you might be asked to reboot your computer).

#### Install WSL and Ubuntu

We can either use `PowerShell` or [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal) which is a modern terminal application that supports various command-line tools and shells.

```
wsl --install --d Ubuntu
```

:::tip Get the install package for your architecture 
If you happen hit issue "[INSERT_ISSUE_MESSAGE_HERE]" you can work around it by changing the default WSL version
with `wsl --set-default-version 1`
:::

Once installed, we will be  asked to provide username and password and be directed in the Ubuntu shell (bash)

### Install required packages

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install gcc make libudev-dev openssl pkg-config -y
```

### Install Rust and add WASM toolchain
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a programming language known for its safety and performance. It's used in NEAR development to write secure and efficient smart contracts.

Then, we need to add the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` toolchain. This toolchain is required because the contracts that we build will be compiled to [WASM](https://webassembly.org/) to run on the NEAR blockchain.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
# When promted press enter for default install options
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### NEAR CLI
The [near-cli-rs](https://github.com/near/near-cli-rs) is a human-friendly companion that has a guided prompt interface helping you interact with the [NEAR Protocol](https://near.org/) from the command line. 

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/near/near-cli-rs/releases/latest/download/near-cli-rs-installer.sh | sh
```

### Cargo NEAR
[cargo-near](https://github.com/near/cargo-near) makes it easier for developers to create, build, and deploy smart contracts on the NEAR blockchain providing scaffold with sensible defaults, saving time setting up new projects.
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/near/cargo-near/releases/latest/download/cargo-near-installer.sh | sh
```

:::tip Different installation methods
If you prefer to install the binaries using npm, you can run the following commands instead
`npm install cargo-near near-cli-rs`

**Or,** install direcly from source:  
`cargo install near-cli-rs cargo-near`

### That's it.
At this point, we are ready to start building on NEAR. Head out to the [Quick Start](http://docs.near.org/build/smart-contracts/quickstart) section of the docs or jump right into the [examples](https://github.com/near-examples).
