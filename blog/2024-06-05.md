In this article, we will cover how to set up your Rust dev environment on Windows using WSL and install relevant tools to build on and interact with NEAR.

### WSL

WSL, or Windows Subsystem for Linux, is a compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables natively on Windows. It allows us to run a GNU/Linux environment directly on Windows without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dual-boot setup.

#### Enable WSL from `Windows Features`

`Control Panel > Programs > Turn Windows Features on or off` 
Scrolling down will reveal the option `Windows Subsystem for Linux`. Make sure it is enabled and press OK to confirm (you might be asked to reboot your computer).

#### Install WSL and Ubuntu

We can either use `PowerShell` or [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal) which is a modern terminal application that supports various command-line tools and shells.

```
wsl --install --d Ubuntu
```

:::tip Get the install package for your architecture 
If you happen hit issue "[INSERT_ISSUE_MESSAGE_HERE]" you can work around it by changing the default WSL version
with `wsl --set-default-version 1`
:::

Once installed, we will be  asked to provide username and password and be directed in the Ubuntu shell (bash)

### Install required packages

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install gcc make libudev-dev openssl pkg-config -y
```

### Install the Developer Tools?

> Now that you have installed WSL, we can leave it prepared for you to start building NEAR smart contracts on it. To build contracts on NEAR you can choose between using Typescript or Rust. Depending what you choose, it is what you will need to install, be mindful that you can install both.

#### Node

#### Rust
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a programming language known for its safety and performance. It's used in NEAR development to write secure and efficient smart contracts.

Then, we need to add the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` toolchain. This toolchain is required because the contracts that we build will be compiled to [WASM](https://webassembly.org/) to run on the NEAR blockchain.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
# When promted press enter for default install options
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### That's it.
At this point, we are ready to start building on NEAR. Head out to the [Quick Start](http://docs.near.org/build/smart-contracts/quickstart) section of the docs or jump right into the [examples](https://github.com/near-examples).
